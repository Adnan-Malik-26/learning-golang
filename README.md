# Go (Golang) Learning Repository

Welcome to my Golang learning repository! This repository tracks my progress in learning the Go programming language and building practical projects using its powerful concurrency and simplicity.

## 🛠 Topics Covered

- Basics of Go Syntax
- Variables, Constants, and Types
- Functions and Error Handling
- Structs and Interfaces
- Concurrency with Goroutines and Channels
- Packages and Modules
- File I/O and Networking
- Testing and Benchmarking
- Web Development with net/http
- Best Practices and Idiomatic Go

## ⚡ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (latest stable version)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any Go-supporting editor

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/golang-learning.git
   cd golang-learning
   ```
2. **Run a Go File**
   ```sh
   go run basics/hello.go
   ```
3. **Run Tests**
   ```sh
   go test ./...
   ```
4. **Build a Project**
   ```sh
   go build -o myapp ./projects/myproject
   ./myapp
   ```
